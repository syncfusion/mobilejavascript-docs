# Generating a Customized Script file

The users with Essential Studio Enterprise license or Essential Studio for JavaScript license can use the Custom Script Generator (CSG) tool to create a single file that packs together only the required scripts and CSS files together. Referring only the required scripts and stylesheets in your application instead of the default ej.mobile.all.min.js that combines the scripts of all the mobile widgets file, enhances the performance of the application’s loading time. This utility can be used to generate both the minified and non-minified version of the scripts and CSS files.



# Getting Started with Custom Script Generator

* Login into the online CSG [link](http://csg.syncfusion.com/) with your DirectTrac credentials. Switch to the Mobile tab and the Custom Script Generator Utility options will be displayed as follows,
