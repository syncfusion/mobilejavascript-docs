2. Password Textbox - Password fields are similar to text fields. The difference is that, the entered password into the password field shows up as dots on the screen in hidden state 

3. Text Area - The HTML &lt;textarea&gt; element represents a multi-line plain-text editing control.

4. Mask Edit Textbox - The Masked Edit control provides restricted data input as well as formatted data output. It generally behaves as a standard text box control with enhancements for optional masked input and formatted output. When you do not use an input mask, the Masked Edit control behaves much like a standard text box.
