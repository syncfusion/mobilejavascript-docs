# Overview

The **Essential JavaScript Mobile Tile widget** is a simple, opaque display of colored rectangles or squares that are arranged on the **Start** screen in a grid-like pattern and it can be either static or live. Tapping (or otherwise selecting) a tile launches the app or other functionality that is represented by the Tile.

**Key Features**

* **Text and Image**: Supports both text and images as the Tile content.

* **Badge support:** Update the Badge value dynamically to show the notifications.
